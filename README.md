# Crop-Prediction-using-Hybrid-Model

The hundreds of thousands of live plants and animals are kept in balance with one another by several ecological processes, including plant diseases, which are a typical component of nature. To improve their defenses against viruses, animals, and insects, plant cells have unique signaling pathways. The hassle statements revolve around the prediction crop-based mostly on climate statistics using device mastering techniques. The purpose of the undertaking is to help the users select a suitable crop to expand so that they can maximize the yield and consequently the profit. Failure of farmers to determine an excellent suitable crop for their land using traditional and non-scientific techniques is a critical trouble for a rustic wherein about 50 percent of the population is involved in farming. Each availability and accessibility of accurate and updated statistics hinders the capability of researchers from operating on developing use case studies. With assets inside our reach, we've proposed a model that can deal with this trouble with the useful resource of supplying predictive insights on crop sustainability and tips based totally on machine reading models knowledgeable considering essential environmental parameters.
